Suggestions from Gary:
1) Many users suggest, and I concur, that making the drop down for the number of albums displayed, “sticky” so that it
   remembers your last selection.  Many users ask how to change the default from 10.

2) Auto update of album art.  This seems to be declining in interest, but was an issue a while ago.  Not a problem for me
   personally, but I do visit sites that are missing quite a bit of artwork.  I know, and use a 3rd party program to do
   library updates, but I’m sure there are many users who would like to see an auto select for missing album art.

3) Folder permissions for users.  This has been pretty big recently.  I know I use public and private sites to segregate
   material, but I too could eliminate one site if I could control which users had access to which folders.

4) Personal suggestion – make Internet TV/Radio section in the left hand column collapsible.  Maybe not a bad idea for
   the letter sections as well.

5) Photo Album section.  This would make SS the complete home media front end if it could handle a photo library,
   perhaps with slideshow capability.
