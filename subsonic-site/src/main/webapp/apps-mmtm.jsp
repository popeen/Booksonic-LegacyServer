    <h3>My Music To Me</h3>

    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mymusicto.me/">My Music To Me</a> (MMTM) allows Subsonic users to enjoy their entire collection by streaming over a Sonos music system.
    </p>

    <p>
        MMTM is a translation service (or proxy) that sits between your Sonos music system and your Subsonic streaming server.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's developed by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nerdyhearn.com/">NerdyHearn</a>.
    </p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Subsonic 5.2 and later has built-in Sonos support, and doesn't require this service.</p>
